The script painter.py utilizes DEAP library (https://github.com/DEAP/deap) to recreate a target picture (pic.jpg/pic.png) uploaded by a user via genetic algorithm. The GA is distinguished by uniform crossover and tournament selection. The picture is represented as a matrix of booleans such that 1 stands for a black pixel and 0 for a white one. The algorithm search for such a matrix, which closely corresponds to an original picture. The best solution in each generation is saved and converted to .png in order to eventually create a .gif animation (movie.gif) sequentially  joining such frames together.
